		<p> My dog, Beatrice, is the highest link on the evolutionary chain. She has humans doing her bidding from as young as <em>toddlers</em>. She could basically be the ruller of the world and <em> no one</em> would question it.
		</p>

		<p>She is a Shetland Sheepdog of pure love and intelligence (when she's not peeing in the house) who runs like the wind. Beatrice herds anything from your children to your various balls. She's the bee's knees man. The bee's <em>freakin'</em> knees.
		</p>

		<p>Why is Beatrice amazing, you ask? (Haven't you been reading along?)</p>

		<ul>
			<li>She's a loving creature</li>
			<li>I mean her ears are just precious</li>
			<li>Oh heck, she's just a doll</li>
		</ul>
		<p> <strong>LOOK AT HER SWIMMING. PRECIOUS SEA DOG</strong></p>
